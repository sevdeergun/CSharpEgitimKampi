C# TRAINING CAMP

I joined this camp to improve my knowledge and skills about the C# programming language. I had the opportunity to improve myself more than I expected. We had a great start to the camp with Murat Yücedağ and I will continue to upload projects to this platform. You can find the technical details of each project below:

📍*Project 1: Basic Topics*
In this project, I learned how to print the output I wanted to the console and how to use int and string type variables.

📍*Project 2: Variables*
In this project, I learned how to receive double, char and string type variables from the user and how to use them in the program.

📍*Project 3: Decision Structures*
In this project, I did some mathematical operations to better understand the logic of using if, if-else and switch-case structures.

📍*Project 4: Loops*
In this project, I combined the decision structures I learned in the previous lesson with while and for loops to perform repetitive operations more easily.

📍*Project 5: Loop with Stars*
In this project, I implemented some logical operations using the for loop.

📍*Project 6: Arrays*
In this project, I learned how to list the elements of arrays, create a new array with data received from the user, and use various methods related to arrays.

📍*Project 7: Foreach Loop*
In this project, I learned how to do some repetitive operations with shorter codes using the foreach loop. I also created a simple exam system using loops.

📍*Project 8: Methods*
In this project, I learned how to use int and string parameters in methods that return and do not return values, and I improved myself in this regard.

📍*Project 9: Database Project*
In this project, I learned how to connect to a database that I created before and list the data in this database.

📍*Project 10: Database CRUD Operations*
In this project, I learned how to add, delete, update and list data in the database that I created on Microsoft SQL Server.
